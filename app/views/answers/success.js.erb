<%# We will need to re-render the form in case there have been previous errors
displayed on it. However, the form expects us to have '@answer' defined to a
new answer, but it's currently defined to an answer that is already persisted
in the database (saved already), so we will need to re-initialize the answer
to a new 'Answer'. %>
