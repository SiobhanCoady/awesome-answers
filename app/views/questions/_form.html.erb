<%# Partial file names usually start with an underscore, by convention. %>

<%# If you pass a persisted ActiveRecord object to the 'form_for' (in the DB),
then 'form_for' will submit a 'PATCH' request (instead of POST) using a
hidden_field technique and the url for hte form will be in this case the'update'
action url, which is in our case quesetion_path(@question) %>

<%# form_for is a built-in Rails helper that enables us to generate a form for
an ActiveRecord model to submit to the associated controller. If you pass in
a non-persisted ActiveRecord object (not in the DB yet) then 'form_for' will
automatically assume that this form will submit to the 'create' action in
the associated controller (in our case, questions#create), which has a path
helper of 'questions_path'. So we must have 'questions_path' defined.

If '@question' has values set to it already, then the form will be prepopulated
with those values. %>

<%= @question.errors.full_messages.join(', ') %>

<%= form_for @question do |f| %>
  <div class="form-group">
    <%= f.label :title %>
    <%= f.text_field :title, class: 'form-control' %>
  </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    <%= f.label :body %>
    <%= f.text_area :body, class: 'form-control' %>
  </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    <%= f.collection_select :tag_ids, Tag.order(:name), :id, :name,
                            {},
                            { multiple: true,
                              class: 'chosen-select form-control',
                              style: 'width: 400px' } %>
  </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    <%= f.submit %>
  </div>
<% end %>
