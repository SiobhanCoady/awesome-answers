// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.js, which will include all the files
// listed below.
//
// Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, vendor/assets/javascripts,
// or any plugin's vendor/assets/javascripts directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
//
// It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the
// compiled file. JavaScript code in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
//
// Read Sprockets README (https://github.com/rails/sprockets#sprockets-directives) for details
// about supported directives.

//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require welcome
//= require chosen-jquery
//= require_tree .

// The last three lines in the comments above are the instructions for the
// manifest file. When you see '//=' in the manifest file, this is actually a
// piece of instruction. In the lines above, the instructions state that we
// will include 'jquery' first, then we will incude 'jquery_ujs' second. Both
// of those come from Gems included by Rails by default.
// 'require_tree .' will require all files, folders, subfolders... recursively
// within the same folder as this file. The files will be included in an
// alphabetical order by default.
// Note that locally, when we're in development mode, the files will be included
// individually (separately), but when we go to production, they will all get
// compiled into a single file called application-DIGEST.js
// If you add your own 'require' statements, then you can choose to include files
// in non-alphabetical order.
// Note that the URL for the compiled (or individual) files will be:
// /assets/FILE_NAME
