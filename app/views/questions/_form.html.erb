<%# Partial file names usually start with an underscore, by convention. %>

<%# If you pass a persisted ActiveRecord object to the 'form_for' (in the DB),
then 'form_for' will submit a 'PATCH' request (instead of POST) using a
hidden_field technique and the url for hte form will be in this case the'update'
action url, which is in our case quesetion_path(@question) %>

<%# form_for is a built-in Rails helper that enables us to generate a form for
an ActiveRecord model to submit to the associated controller. If you pass in
a non-persisted ActiveRecord object (not in the DB yet) then 'form_for' will
automatically assume that this form will submit to the 'create' action in
the associated controller (in our case, questions#create), which has a path
helper of 'questions_path'. So we must have 'questions_path' defined.

If '@question' has values set to it already, then the form will be prepopulated
with those values. %>

<%= simple_form_for @question do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :title %>
  <%= f.input :body, required: false %>
  <%= f.association :tags, input_html: { class: 'chosen-select input-new-line',
                                         style: 'width: 400px' } %>
  <%= f.submit class: 'btn btn-primary' %>
<% end %>
