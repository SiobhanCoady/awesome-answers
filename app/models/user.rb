class User < ApplicationRecord
  # If you add an attribute accessor to an ActiveRecord object, then you will be
  # able to caputre that from the form and have it in memory, but it will not be
  # stored in the database if you don't have a database field for it.
  # attr_accessor :abc
  # We don't have to do this for 'password' and 'password_confirmation' if we
  # use 'f.password_field' because Rails automatically adds attribute accesesors
  # for these two special fields.

  # has_secure_password is a built-in Rails method that helps us with user
  # authentication.
  # 1. It will automatically add a presence validator for the password field
  # 2. When given a password, it will generate a salt, then it will hash the
  # salt and password combo, and will store the result of the Hashing (using
  # bcrypt) along with the randomly-generated salt into a database field called
  # 'password_digest'.
  # 3. If you skip 'password_confirmation' field, then it won't give you a
  # validation error for that. It you provide 'password_confirmation', then
  # it will validate that the password matches the password_confirmation
  # 4. We will get a method called 'authenticate' that will help us test if the
  # user has entered the correct password or not.
