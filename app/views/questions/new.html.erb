<h1>New Question</h1>

<%# render helps you insert (or render) a partial, so Rails expects in here
that you've defined a partial within the same folder as this file (new.html.erb)
called '_form.html.erb'. So the file path should be:
'/app/views/question/_form.html.erb'
Note that partials will have access to instance variables, so there is no need
to pass them explicitly. If you want to pass a local variable, then you will
need to do so explicitly, as in: render 'form', my_var: 'abc'
Also, if the partial is in another folder, such as contact, then you will have
to put the full path for the partial, as in: render '/contact/form' %>
<%= render 'form' %>
